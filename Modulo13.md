# Public Report

**Theme:** Dashboard Development for Indicator Management

**Objective:** Develop two dashboards: one for the Customer Service area and another for the Supply area, both focused on the goals established by the IT department of the company Atvos. These dashboards will allow operational staff to monitor the progress of their activities and goals on a daily basis.

## Module 1

**Sprint 1**  
 In the first sprint, a TAPI was developed to plan the year's deliveries. This TAPI includes sections such as the final product vision, project scope, roadmap, general information, user stories, general schedule, among other important points. With this delivery, it was possible to define what would be important and valuable for the project.

**Sprint 2**  
 In the second sprint, I carried out the mapping and recognition of the project, defining the persona, user journeys, risk matrix, and CSD matrix. This helped to better understand the users’ needs and the possible risks of this first module, allowing adjustments in the upcoming sprints to meet users’ needs and minimize risks.

**Sprint 3**  
 In the third sprint, we defined the entire visual concept and the functionalities that would be presented to users. Mockups and a style guide were created for the dashboards to be delivered in this first module, facilitating the actual visual construction in Power BI.

**Sprint 4**  
 In the fourth sprint, we finalized the project by building the dashboards in Power BI and performing data modeling. Thus, we delivered the first version of the Customer Service and Inventory dashboards.

**Sprint 5**  
 In the fifth sprint, I conducted user testing through online interviews, focusing on accessibility and user needs. The final presentation to the partner was also carried out.

## Module 2

 The next module will focus on developing a dashboard for the IT Infrastructure area, where the activity indicators and goals of the area will be displayed.

**Sprint 1**  
 In the first sprint, the focus will be on mapping the necessary functionalities for an operational dashboard for the Infrastructure area. We will define the persona, value proposition, user journey, and user stories, enabling a deeper understanding of the target audience and their needs.

**Sprint 2**  
 In the second sprint, a mockup will be developed presenting the dashboard’s visual, providing a first glimpse of the final product. Additionally, a second version of the style guide will be created, bringing a consistent visual identity to the project.

**Sprint 3**  
 In the third sprint, the focus will be on data modeling and solution architecture, detailing how the data is extracted, processed, and transformed, showing the ETL process.

**Sprint 4**  
 In the fourth sprint, the visual will be built in Power BI and connected to real data, resulting in the first version of the dashboard.

**Sprint 5**  
 In the final sprint, tests and adjustments will be made for the final version of the dashboard.

## Conclusion

 The final course project aims to implement management based on a visible view of indicators in the IT area, where key performance indicators (KPIs) are presented visually and accessibly to the entire team. This allows real-time monitoring and more informed decision-making.  
 In the first module, the focus was on the technology service desk and inventory of technological resources of the company. In the second module, the focus will be on infrastructure, covering goals and activities related to the availability, access, and latency of Atvos systems.  
 By making these indicators visible to users, we promote a sense of accountability and a clear direction for improvements. In the final module, a dashboard will be developed that integrates all subarea dashboards, providing an executive and strategic view of the goals and allowing the analysis of the impact of this management methodology on the IT area as a whole.
